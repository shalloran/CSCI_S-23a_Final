# CSCI_S-23a_Final

## GD50 / CSCI S-23a Final Project

Initial outline, approved by James, 28 July 2019:

For my final project for CSCI S-23a I would like to implement a few things in Zelda, as follows:

1. Implement a score keeper perhaps near the top right of the screen.
2. Implement keys that are randomly dropped from killed enemies - but perhaps only those that you kill with the pots.
3. Implement a way to keep track of these keys perhaps near the middle top of the screen.
4. Implement chests that are unlocked with the correct colored keys.
